# Firefighter Sleep Disruption

## Purpose

Firefighters must respond to emergency calls during the night. These disruptions contribute significantly to long term physical and mental stress. While these disruptions cannot be prevented completely, knowing which stations and shifts are impacted the most and why can allow fire department command staff to implement policies or technology to mitigate them. Some possible mitigations include balancing night-time load among adjacent stations by adjusting dispatch priority to zones differently at night (a separate run-card), reducing low-acuity calls by identifying them earlier and adjusting dispatch procedures, implementing technology to wake only the specific personnel assigned to the dispatched unit rather than the whole station, and staffing nights dynamically based on predicted demand.
